# REACT-NATIVE

### FlatList Element

**Turns an array into a list of elements**

**We are required to pass in a `prop` of `data` the array of data that we are going to create a bunch of elements out of**

**Also required to pass in `renderItem` prop - function that will turn each individual item into an element**

**If you are coming from React on the web, you might be used to `mapping` an array of data to build a list = - FlatList is better with RN**
